			<p> I have many interests, but right now my energies are focused on expanding my repertoire in Web Development and Design.  I completed a Full-Stack Web Dev course at Jefferson State Community College, and through online courses, persistance, and passion, I am continuing to hone my skills.  My focus has been on front-end and core technologies, learning to write good, clean and reusable code is one of my many goals.  I have finally found my niche because development allows me to bring my imagination to life, it is exciting to think about what the future holds.
			</p>
			<p>  I have had many hobbies and creative pursuits over the years including photography, guitar, sketching/art, and reading non-fiction.  I consider myself a student of life, I'm rarely satisfied until I can see the big picture. I've always enjoyed learning, and turned to books whenever I wanted to explore a new subject.  I have an inquisitive mindset and like figuring out how things work, from body and mind, to hardware and software.  Programming seems to be the perfect way combine all these interests, help others and keep my passion for learning going on forever.  Thank you for your visit.
