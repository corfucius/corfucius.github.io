			<p> I have many interests, but right now my energies are focused on expanding my repertoire in Software Development. I completed a Full-Stack Web Devevelopment course at Jefferson State Community College, and through persistance and passion, I am continuing to hone my skills. My focus has been on core technologies, for instance, vanilla javascript over jquery, plain old php over wordpress. I recently completed over 500 hours of apprenticeship at a fantastic company called Kinetic. It was a great opportunity and helped me realize the importance of programming fundamentals, and it inspired me to zero in and strive to better understand the universal principles behind writing good code that apply to all programming languages.
			</p>
			<p>  I have had many hobbies and creative pursuits over the years including photography, guitar, sketching/art, and reading non-fiction. I consider myself a student of life, I'm rarely satisfied until I can see the big picture. I enjoy figuring out how things work, from body and mind, to hardware and software.
